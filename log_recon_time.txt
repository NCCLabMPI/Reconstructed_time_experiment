----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! ----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

WARNING: Couldn't compute a reliable estimate of monitor refresh interval! Trouble with VBL syncing?!?


----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! ----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.


PTB-INFO: Support for fast OffscreenWindows enabled.
PTB-ERROR: OpenML timestamping reports that flip completed before it was scheduled [Scheduled no earlier than 14943.936506 secs, completed at 14917.729509 secs]!
PTB-ERROR: This could mean that sync of bufferswaps to vertical retrace is broken or some other driver bug! Switching to alternative timestamping method.
PTB-ERROR: Check your system setup!


PTB-ERROR: Screen('Flip'); beamposition timestamping computed an *impossible stimulus onset value* of 14943.963022 secs, which would indicate that
PTB-ERROR: stimulus onset happened *before* it was actually requested! (Earliest theoretically possible 14943.968546 secs).

PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): rawTimestamp = 14943.970029, scanline = 455
PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): line_pre_swaprequest = 355, line_post_swaprequest = 374, time_post_swaprequest = 14943.968832
PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): preflip_vblcount = 1577, preflip_vbltimestamp = 14943.979404
PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): postflip_vblcount = 0, postflip_vbltimestamp = -1.000000, vbltimestampquery_retrycount = 0

PTB-ERROR: This error can be due to either of the following causes (No way to discriminate):
PTB-ERROR: Either something is broken in your systems beamposition timestamping. I've disabled high precision
PTB-ERROR: timestamping for now. Returned timestamps will be less robust and accurate, but if that was the culprit it should be fixed.

PTB-ERROR: An equally likely cause would be that Synchronization of stimulus onset (buffer swap) to the
PTB-ERROR: vertical blank interval VBL is not working properly.
PTB-ERROR: Please run the script PerceptualVBLSyncTest to check this. With non-working sync to VBL, all stimulus timing
PTB-ERROR: becomes quite futile. Also read 'help SyncTrouble' !

PTB-INFO: that i couldn't detect the duration of the vertical blank interval and won't be able to correct timestamps
PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
PTB-INFO: enable the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAM', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.

PTB-ERROR: This could mean that sync of bufferswaps to vertical retrace is broken or some other driver bug! Switching to alternative timestamping method.
PTB-ERROR: Check your system setup!


PTB-ERROR: Screen('Flip'); beamposition timestamping computed an *impossible stimulus onset value* of 15463.117019 secs, which would indicate that
PTB-ERROR: stimulus onset happened *before* it was actually requested! (Earliest theoretically possible 15463.123332 secs).

PTB-ERROR: This error can be due to either of the following causes (No way to discriminate):
PTB-ERROR: Either something is broken in your systems beamposition timestamping. I've disabled high precision
PTB-ERROR: timestamping for now. Returned timestamps will be less robust and accurate, but if that was the culprit it should be fixed.

PTB-ERROR: An equally likely cause would be that Synchronization of stimulus onset (buffer swap) to the
PTB-ERROR: vertical blank interval VBL is not working properly.
PTB-ERROR: Please run the script PerceptualVBLSyncTest to check this. With non-working sync to VBL, all stimulus timing
PTB-ERROR: becomes quite futile. Also read 'help SyncTrouble' !
